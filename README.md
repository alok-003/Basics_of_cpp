# Objective:
To learn the basics of C++ programming

Description:
C++ is a versatile programming language known for its efficiency and control. It features variables to store data, such as integers (int), floating-point numbers (float and double), characters (char), and boolean values (bool). Operators like arithmetic (+, -, *, /), relational (==, !=, >, <), and logical (&&, ||, !) are used to manipulate these variables. Control statements, including `if`, `else`, `while`, and `for`, manage the flow of the program. Input and output are handled via the `cin` and `cout` streams, respectively, enabling interaction with the user.
